DO NOT FREAK OUT, I JUST DECOMPOSED THE TODOS INTO SIMPLER TODOS!

If done, anottate next to the todo (Done)

1) Create a user collection in appwrite so that you can progress further [done]
2) Once the user signs up, store the information in the user document [done]
3) Right after the user has signed up successfully, prompt him to select an avatar, unless he/she already exists in the db
4) Once the user has selected an avatar, upload it to the file bucket
5) Once the avatar uploads, store it to the user collection, unless the user already exists
6) Create the user search functionality (user the appwrite queries for this one)
7) Create the UI for each feature you have to create later on (Do not moan like a bitch and do it!)
